# ScarfParty v2

A nice small, clean, non-angular, es6 rewrite of ScarfParty, the two-colour double-sided pixel-pattern scarf knitting 
tracker tool.

This app is build with the FT's [Origami Build Tools](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami-build-tools), and makes use of the
FT's [polyfill service](https://cdn.polyfill.io/).
