# ScarfParty v2

ScarfParty is a web-based companion for knitting a [two-colour, double-sided, pixel-pattern-based scarf](http://blog.lrnk.co.uk/tag/the-christmas-fam-scarf/).

V2 of ScarfParty is a nice, clean, ES6 rewrite of the original AngularJS app, using absolutely no big JavaScript megaframeworks, and making use of [Origami Build Tools](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami-build-tools) and the [polyfill service](https://cdn.polyfill.io/), both of which are developed and maintained by the good people at the Financial Times.
